    <img src="images/turingmain.jpeg" id="mainimage">
    <p> Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 â€“ 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.
         Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.
         Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
          Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime, due to his homosexuality, which was then a crime in the UK.
